## Introduction

The Minishell project provides a foundational understanding of shell operations, including process management, command execution, and input/output handling in Unix-like systems. It is a part of the curriculum designed to enhance proficiency in C programming and Unix system calls.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute commands using `execve` based on the PATH variable.
- **Built-in Commands**: Implement shell built-ins such as `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.
- **Redirections**: Support input and output redirection (`<`, `>`, `<<`, `>>`).
- **Pipelines**: Implement command pipelines using the `|` character.
- **Signal Handling**: Manage signals like `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D`, and `ctrl-\`.
- **Quoting**: Handle single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) appropriately.
- **Environment Variables**: Expand environment variables (`$VAR`) and special variables like `$?`.
- **History**: Maintain a command history and support navigating through it using arrow keys.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully and ensure no memory leaks.
- **Makefile**: Provided Makefile with `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, and `re` rules for easy compilation and cleanup.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minishell.git
   cd minishell
   ```

2. Compile the program:

   ```

## Usage

- After launching Minishell, you will see a prompt awaiting your commands.
- Enter commands and press `Enter` to execute them.
- Use `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit` built-ins as per shell requirements.
- Explore input/output redirection, command pipelines, and signal handling functionalities.
